# Disjunction in Middle Egyptian

This example is based on one in Allen's excellent [Middle Egyptian: An
Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs][allen].

H: 𓊃𓀀𓏤 | 𓊃𓏏𓁐 | 𓂋𓏤𓊪𓅱
L: s | s.t | r-pw
G: man | woman | whichever
T: either [a] man or [a] woman

You can emphasize an "or" by following the options with {r-pw}.
